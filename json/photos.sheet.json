    "chatter": "In Mike Leach's first Apple Cup, the Cougars faced a 28-10 fourth-quarter deficit, seemingly destined for a disappointing 2-10 season. But, as we all know, crazy things can happen when these teams get together. Staring an 18-point deficit squarely in the face, the Cougars didn't blink. Senior quarterback Jeff Tuel led two touchdown drives -- both capped by Carl Winston rushing scores -- and just like that, WSU was within striking distance. After the potential game-winning field goal by UW's Travis Coons sailed wide right, the Cougs forced a turnover in overtime and put the finishing touches on the largest Apple Cup comeback ever. ",

But Jake Locker and the Huskies would not go away, bouncing back for two scores of their own. With the game knotted at 35-35 in the final minute, QB Alex Brink dropped back for a 35-yard strike to WR Brandon Gibson, delivering the dagger to UW. Brink ended the day with 399 yards and 5 TDs, while also securing his third win over UW in four tries -- most ever by a WSU quarterback.",

    "chatter": "The Huskies entered this 2002 matchup as huge underdogs against the No. 3 WSU Cougars -- an Apple Cup rarity. Despite the odds, UW played inspired football in Seattle, looking to topple their foes to the east. Facing a 17-7 halftime deficit, Cody Pickett and the Huskies stormed back to tie the game in the second half, forcing overtime. After trading blows in overtime, the game would be decided on one of the most controversial plays in Apple Cup history. The play came on a throw by backup quarterback Matt Kegel – in for the injured Jason Gesser. The pass, intended to be a screen pass the wide receiver ended up being batted down by defensive lineman Kai Ellis. But rather than being ruled an incompletion, referee Gordon Riese swiftly ended the game with a call that will ring in the ears of Huskies and Cougar fans forever:\r\n\r\n“The ruling on the field was that it was a backwards pass. Washington recovered that pass, and the game is over.”",

    "chatter": "Don James entered his first game in Pullman to face the two-win Cougars with his undefeated Huskies ranked No. 5 in the country and Rose Bowl hopes on the line. It was also the first game to take place in Pullman in 28 years, as WSU had previously hosted the Apple Cup in Spokane. The switch, along with WSU's strategy of using two quarterbacks, was enough to throw the Huskies off on that Saturday afternoon. The Cougars, who were 18-point underdogs, rallied behind the Martin Stadium crowd from a 17-7 halftime deficit to pull ahead in the second half. \nBut after a costly interception by Casper, the game seemed all but over for Washington State as UW lined up for a field goal that would have put the Huskies ahead 23-21. But UW kicker Chuck Nelson, who hadn’t missed a kick all season, missed the 32-yard attempt and the Cougars went on to win, 24-20. WSU fans stormed the field and tore down the goal posts.",

    "chatter": "After a disappointing 5-5 start to the season, Husky fans were unsettled with the team and first-year coach Don James. Tensions only escalated after the Huskies fell behind the Cougars (3-7) by 13 points late in the game, after entering the contest as a double-digit favorite. The Cougars had the ball and the lead in Husky territory when WSU coach Jim Sweeney opted for the knockout punch rather than settling for a field goal that likely would have iced the game. On fourth-and-one from the UW 14-yard line, WSU quarterback John Hopkins threw a pass over the middle that was picked off by UW safety Al Burleson and returned 93 yards for a touchdown. The Huskies got the ball back With 1:58 to play and needed a touchdown to win. Quarterback Warren Moon heaved a deep pass toward wide receiver Spider Gaines. Two WSU defensive backs couldn’t pick it off, and the ball was tipped into the arms of Gaines, who took the ball the rest of the way for a touchdown and a 28-27 UW victory.\n\n",

Perhaps the most famous pass in WSU history came on a third-quarter connection when Bledsoe found a diving Philip Bobo in the back of the end zone with a 44-yard pass. Bobo slid into a pile of snow underneath the goal posts as Bledsoe pumped his arms infront of the snow-covered Cougar faithful.",

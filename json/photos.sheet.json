    "chatter": "In Mike Leach's first Apple Cup, the Cougars faced a 28-10 fourth-quarter deficit, seemingly destined for a disappointing 2-10 season. But, as we all know, crazy things can happen when these teams get together. Staring an 18-point deficit squarely in the face, the Cougars didn't blink. Senior quarterback Jeff Tuel led two touchdown drives -- both capped by Carl Winston rushing scores -- and just like that, WSU was within striking distance. After the potential game-winning field goal by UW's Travis Coons sailed wide right, the Cougs forced a turnover in overtime and put the finishing touches on the largest Apple Cup comeback ever. ",

    "chatter": "The 100th meeting between the two teams also turned into one of the most thrilling. After falling behind 10-0 early, WSU rallied back to take a 28-20 lead in the second half. But Jake Locker and the Huskies would not go away, bouncing back for two scores of their own. With the game knotted at 35-35 in the final minute, QB Alex Brink dropped back for a 35-yard strike to WR Brandon Gibson, delivering the dagger to UW. Brink ended the day with 399 yards and 5 TDs, while also securing his third win over UW in four tries -- most ever by a WSU quarterback.",

Perhaps the most famous pass in WSU history came on a third-quarter connection when Bledsoe found a diving Philip Bobo in the back of the end zone with a 44-yard pass. Bobo slid into a pile of snow underneath the goal posts as Bledsoe pumped his arms infront of the snow-covered Cougar faithful.",
